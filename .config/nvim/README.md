## Structure

Each plugin to be installed is defined in `plugins.lua` and each plugin has its own configuration file (if necessary) in `lua/config/` which is loaded by packer.

```sh
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ after
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ftplugin      # file specific settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.lua          # main entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lua
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/       # each plugin configuration is in its own file
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ autocmd.lua   # autocommands
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ functions.lua # lua functions to extend functionality
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mappings.lua  # Vim keymaps definitions -> config/which.lua for more
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ options.lua   # non plugin related (vim) options
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins.lua   # define plugins to be managed via Packer
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user-conf.lua # parameters to configure some settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin            # packer_compiled
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ snippets          # snippets directory (luasnip style)
```

## Which-key leader key clusters

Mappings are clustered according to their topic/tool.

See `./lua/config/which.lua` for details.

| key | cluster                                                |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| b   | Buffer management                                      |
| c   | Language specific actions (only in Go, e.g. run tests) |
| f   | File management                                        |
| g   | Git actions                                            |
| h   | Harpoon integration                                    |
| l   | LSP integration (only when a LSP is attached)          |
| m   | Misc stuff                                             |

| s   | Searching                                              |
| w   | Window management                                      |
| x   | Languagetool integration                               |
| z   | Spell bindings                                         |

## User configuration (experimental)

Additionally I implemented some further lightweight configuration options that might be useful.

All options can be found in `./lua/user-conf.lua`.

## Remove plugins

Basically, you can remove unwanted plugins by just removing the appropriate line in `./lua/plugins.lua` and, if applicable, delete its configuration file in `./lua/config/`.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keep in mind that some plugins are configured to work in conjunction with other plugins. For instance, autopairs is configured in `./lua/config/treesitter.lua`. For now there is no logic implemented that cross-checks such dependencies.

## Add plugins

If you want to follow my method adding a plugin is straight forward:

In `lua/plugins.lua` add the plugin to Packer. You are free to use a name for the configuration file (should be a valid filename).

```lua
use {"<Address-of-the-plugin>", config = get_config("<name-of-the-plugin>")}
```

Create `lua/config/<name-of-the-plugin>.lua` where you put the plugins settings. If your plugin does not require additional configuration or loading you can omit the config part.

Open another instance of Neovim (I always try to keep one running instance of Neovim open in case I messed up my config) and run `PackerSync`.

## Requirements

There are some tools that are required in order to use some features/plugins:
